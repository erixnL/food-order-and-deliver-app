## Project Description

This project is to develop a software system aimed at facilitating the connection between local restaurants and residents. The system is designed to offer an Online Order and Delivery Service, allowing customers to select items available in nearby restaurants. A courier will then deliver the prepared food directly to the customer's doorstep. Additionally, restaurants will have the capability to edit their daily menu or the items they offer for sale.

*This is the group project of UOW ISIT950 subject.
